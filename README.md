# Web Page Design - Spring 2018

## Chapter 8 - Multimedia

**Discussion:** In Chapter 8, you will learn how to add multimedia content such as audio and video to a web page.

1. Complete the chapter tutorial on pages 361-385 using the files in the chapter/ folder.
1. For the lab, you may choose to do one of the three labs at the end of chapter 8 and the files for those labs are available in the labs/ folder. _Or_, you may choose to use one of these labs as a template for something else that you'd rather do. It must involve creating a web page with some audio or video content.

When you are finished, push the entire repository back to github.
